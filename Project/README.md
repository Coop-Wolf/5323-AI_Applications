## Problem

Traditional collaborative filtering recommendation systems rely heavily on historical user–item interactions, making them ineffective for new users with little or no rating data. This project investigates whether a content-based recommendation approach can provide more accurate and diverse movie recommendations in cold-start scenarios. Using the MovieLens dataset, the performance of content-based filtering is compared against collaborative filtering under simulated cold-start conditions.

# Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a recommendation technique that predicts a user’s preferences by analyzing patterns of interaction across many users. It assumes that users who have behaved similarly in the past will have similar preferences in the future. Instead of relying on item characteristics, collaborative filtering uses user–item interaction data such as ratings, likes, views, or clicks to identify similarities between users or between items. Based on these similarities, the system recommends items that the user has not yet interacted with.

# Content-Based Filtering

Content-based filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items to a user based on the similarity between item features and the user’s past preferences. It builds a personalized user profile using item attributes such as genres, keywords, tags, or textual descriptions. Recommendations are generated by matching this user profile with items that have similar features, allowing the system to recommend items without relying on the behavior or preferences of other users.


## The Process

I'll be implementing two systems
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Filtering

## How to simlulate "cold start"

For a user
- Keep 0-3 ratings
- Hide the rest
Generate recommendations
Compare against hidden ratings

Inputs
- Movie metadata
- Sparce user ratings (0-3 movies)

Output
- Top-N movie recommendations (5 or 10)

## Algorithm
Content-Based appraoch
1. Represent each movie as a vector
- Genres -> one-hot encoding
- Tags -> TF-IDF
2. Build a user profile vecotr
- Average of liked movie vectors
3. Compute similarity
- Cosine simularity
4. Rank movies by similarity score
Collaborative filtering baseline
- User-based CF with cosine similarity
- item-based CF

## Evaluation
