I've got models for Content-Based and Collaborative Based.
They're not cold start scenarios to my knowledge
Haven't done a hybrid approach.
Two models are using different datasets

What now?



Assignment 1:

Knowing the input and output of my model, develop a model for it.



Steps for project:

1. Have them use the same dataset
2. Get working with one model first
    2.1 Fine tune model
        2.1.1 Increase/decrease ratings
        2.1.2 See if model is recommending properly
