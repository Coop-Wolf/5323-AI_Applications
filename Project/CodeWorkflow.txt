The Complete Workflow

Step 1: Get a Single User

Pick one user (e.g., user_id = 196)
Extract all their ratings

Step 2: Split Their Ratings

Keep some ratings (e.g., 5%) → This is what the model "knows" about the user
Hide some ratings (e.g., 95%) → These are the movies we'll try to predict

Step 3: Train the Model

Use the kept ratings to learn what this user likes
For content-based: "User likes Action and Sci-Fi movies"
For collaborative filtering: "User rates similar to users X, Y, Z"

Step 4: Generate Recommendations

Model predicts ratings for movies the user hasn't rated yet (from the model's perspective)
Generate a list of top N recommended movies

Step 5: Evaluation

Compare the model's recommendations against the hidden ratings
Check if:

The hidden high-rated movies appear in recommendations (precision/recall)
The predicted ratings are close to actual ratings (RMSE, MAE)
